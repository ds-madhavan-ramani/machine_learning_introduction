# Machine Learning Introduction

A collection of notebooks for teaching machine learning. We'll use OpenML to explain and experiment with many machine learning algorithms in more depth. Most code will be in Python, and we will use scikit-learn extensively.


## Sources
We will be using code examples from the following books. You are warmly recommended to read them for a more complete coverage of machine learning:

"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by [Andreas Mueller](http://amueller.io) and [Sarah Guido](https://twitter.com/sarah_guido). You can find details about the book on the [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do>). We'll be using the included mglearn package to make plotting easier.
